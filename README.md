# automation-with-selenium

Very fun project here where I made use of Selenium to automate task on the browser.

After cloning this repo to satisfy your curiosity, you will need to :
```terminal
pip3 install selenium
```
and please be sure your chrome browser is up to date by going into the settings and updating to the latest version, if not already done.

For this exercice, I'm automating actions on my previous project, the portfolio with flask backend. By running the script, you'll see that you're taken to my website on the contact page and the form will be fulfilled with what's contained in the script, then be submitted. I'll be glad to check the csv that's being updated thanks to the script on the flask server :)

Have a nice day.
